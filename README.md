War. War never changes. 
For as long as the internet has existed, brainrot has always existed alongside it. YouTube Poop, MLG, surrealism, Among Us, Skibiti Toilet, Hawk Tuah, Trollface Crashouts, all the same phenomenon in a different package. Every time someone discovers that "loud = funny," they discover a goldmine to exploit, and all of it from the humor of children.
Parents panic over it, as it morphs their brains into something unrecognizable, something easily manipulated, something that people can exploit, and their contemporaries breed hate for it, but eventually fall for it themselves. 
Sometimes they succeed in stopping it, but the moment it's gone, something else always takes its place, starting the cycle anew, always ending in the same results. 

For war never changes.
